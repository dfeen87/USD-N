# USD-N

**The New U.S. Dollar**  
*A sovereign, programmable monetary system governed by the FIDES Protocol.*

---

## Overview

**USD-N** is a digitally native evolution of the United States Dollar designed to operate
alongside the legacy USD at full **1:1 parity**.

It is **not a replacement currency**, not a speculative asset, and not a conventional
central bank digital currency (CBDC).  
USD-N is an **asset-backed, transparently auditable, programmable dollar rail** built to
modernize monetary infrastructure while preserving U.S. monetary sovereignty.

USD-N is governed by the **FIDES Protocol** — a rule-based fiscal system that enforces
inflation control, debt discipline, and transparency through immutable code rather than
discretionary policy.

## Design Principles

USD-N is built on a small set of non-negotiable principles:

- **Parity First**  
  Permanent 1:1 parity with the U.S. Dollar.

- **Sovereign Neutrality**  
  No ad-hoc monetary actions. Rules are explicit, auditable, and enforced automatically.

- **Transparency by Design**  
  Supply changes, reserve backing, and fiscal operations are publicly verifiable.

- **Programmable, Not Arbitrary**  
  Monetary logic is deterministic, constrained, and rule-based.

- **Interoperable**  
  Designed to integrate with existing financial infrastructure and public blockchain
  systems without fragmentation.

## What USD-N Is

- A **digitally native dollar rail**
- **Fully collateralized** by verifiable real-world assets
- **Programmable** for precision fiscal operations
- **Auditable** in real time
- **Interoperable** with public blockchain ecosystems
- **Governed by code**, not committees

---

## What USD-N Is Not

- ❌ Not a speculative cryptocurrency  
- ❌ Not a privately issued stablecoin  
- ❌ Not a surveillance CBDC  
- ❌ Not a replacement for Bitcoin or Ethereum  
- ❌ Not a political instrument  

USD-N is designed to **complement decentralized systems**, not compete with them.

---

## Asset Backing

Each USD-N unit is backed by a diversified, verifiable reserve basket, including:

- U.S. Treasury instruments  
- Certified physical gold  
- Tokenized clean energy credits  
- Mission-critical industrial commodities  

Reserves are governed by **on-chain proof-of-reserve contracts** and independent audits.

## The FIDES Protocol

**FIDES**  
(*Fiscal Integrity via Digital Economic Sovereignty*)

FIDES is the autonomous fiscal engine that governs USD-N.

It enforces:

- Algorithmic inflation targeting  
- Programmable debt amortization  
- Supply modulation tied to real economic signals  
- Immutable fiscal auditability  

FIDES replaces discretionary monetary intervention with **rule-based execution**.

---

## Relationship to Bitcoin & Ethereum

USD-N does not displace existing decentralized systems.

- **Bitcoin** remains digital scarcity and a store of value.  
- **Ethereum** remains the global programmable execution layer.  

USD-N provides a **sovereign-grade, stable, auditable unit of account** that interoperates
with both.

This is **harmonization**, not competition.

---

## Status

This repository defines the **core specification and reference implementation** for USD-N.

- Experimental  
- Non-legal-tender  
- Open specification  
- Designed for audit, simulation, and eventual institutional adoption  

---

## Philosophy

> Trust should not be assumed.  
> It should be enforced by design.

USD-N exists to demonstrate that monetary systems can be:

- Transparent without surveillance  
- Disciplined without austerity  
- Programmable without political discretion
